  intermediary data without having to use the "Keep Data" plugin. The keep data
  plugin has been removed.

- Added the plugin names to the node result titles in case that no
  user-defined node label has been set.
- The active node is now handled by the Tree itself to have consistent and
  up to date behaviour for all consumers.

  add them to the Workflow at designated positions.
- Added coordinate transformations to data browser (for images the same size as
  the detector defined in the SetupExperiment.
- Added feature to automatically store the GUI state on exit and added a menu
  action to restore the exit state.
- Sanitized all module docstrings.

  data (e.g. 2d-integration with only one azimuthal value).
- Fixed an issue with azimuthal units in radians in the pyFAI 2d integration
  plugin.
- Fixed an issue with RemoveOutlierPlugin which did not dectect peaks of 
  diffenent sign (e.g. in background-corrected data).  
- Fixed an issue with hanging initialization when restoring the GUI state 
  at start-up.

v0.1.9
======
Major changes:
--------------

  imported results as a scan timeline and to have the correct labels.
- The nodes in the WorkflowTree editor now also display the node IDs and labels.
- If the app is busy with locally running the Workflow in the TestWorkflowFrame,
  the mouse cursor will show a busy system.
- Added an uninstaller script to remove registry information and local data
  (e.g. logfiles)
