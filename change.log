--------------
- Dataset class has been reworked to function correctly with more numpy ufuncs,
  in particularly with np.take.

Improvements
------------
- Added settings for displaying only a limited floating point precision of 
  Parameters.
- Removed redundant button to store pyFAI calibration settings.
- Changed Parameter names in ScanSetup class for better consistency.
- Changed names of buttons from "load" or "save" to "import" or "export" for 
  consistency.

- If the app is busy with locally running the Workflow in the TestWorkflowFrame,
  the mouse cursor will show a busy system.
