Composite image creator frame
=============================

The Composite image creator frame is a graphical interface to configure the 
:py:class:`CompositeCreatorApp <pydidas.apps.CompositeCreatorApp>` and to
visualize the results.

The pyFAI calibration frame is an embedded version of the `pyFAI-calib2 
<https://pyfai.readthedocs.io/en/master/man/pyFAI-calib2.html>`_ tool. For a 
tutorial, please refer to the pyFAI documentation on the 
`Calibration of a diffraction setup using the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
